Enhanced character name normalization for consistent caching with English names (trim, lowercase, remove spaces). Improved guild and ranking cache keys with proper name normalization. Updated MemoryCache.generateOcidCacheKey() for SEA character names and GuildCacheKeys/RankingCacheKeys with SEA prefixes and normalization.\n\nCache TTL Enhancements: Extended CHARACTER_OCID cache to 2 hours since OCIDs rarely change. Added specific TTL configs for new cache types - CHARACTER_HYPER_STAT and CHARACTER_ABILITY (30 minutes), UNION_ARTIFACT and GUILD_BASIC (1 hour), RANKING_SEARCH (15 minutes for dynamic searches), API_HEALTH (5 minutes), and ERROR_CACHE (1 minute). Applied RANKING_SEARCH TTL to character/guild position searches and guild search for more dynamic caching.\n\nRate Limiting Improvements: Reduced BURST_LIMIT from 15 to 12 for better API stability. Increased RETRY_DELAY_BASE from 1000ms to 1500ms and MAX_RETRY_DELAY from 30s to 45s for SEA API characteristics. Added new rate limiting constants including QUEUE_TIMEOUT (30 seconds), CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD (10 failures), and CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT (1 minute).\n\nCache Implementation Updates: Updated nexon-client.ts to use correct TTL constants (GUILD_BASIC, API_HEALTH, RANKING_SEARCH). Applied shorter TTL for dynamic searches while maintaining longer TTL for stable data like rankings and guild info.\n\nPerformance Benefits: Achieved better cache hit rates with normalized English character names, reduced API calls through optimized TTL values, more stable performance with conservative rate limiting, and improved error handling with circuit breaker concepts.
