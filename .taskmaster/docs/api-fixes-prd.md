# MapleStory SEA MCP Server - API Issues Resolution and Enhancement

## Project Overview

The MapleStory SEA MCP Server is experiencing critical API connectivity and performance issues that are affecting user experience. The current server status shows multiple health degradations that need immediate attention and systematic resolution.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues Identified

1. **Nexon API Connection Issues**
   - Overall ranking endpoint failures
   - Inconsistent API response times
   - Connection timeouts affecting user queries
   - Specific failure in ranking/overall endpoint

2. **Memory Performance Issues**
   - High heap usage at 88% indicating memory leaks
   - Degraded memory performance affecting server stability
   - Potential memory optimization needed across the codebase

3. **Error Handling and Resilience**
   - Insufficient error handling for API failures
   - No fallback mechanisms when Nexon API is unavailable
   - Poor user experience when services are degraded

4. **Monitoring and Health Checks**
   - Current health check system needs enhancement
   - Better error reporting and diagnostics needed
   - Real-time status monitoring improvements required
