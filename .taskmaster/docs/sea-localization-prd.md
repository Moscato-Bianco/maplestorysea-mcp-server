# MapleStory SEA MCP Server - Localization and API Support

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a localized MapleStory SEA MCP Server based on the original maplestory-mcp-server, providing comprehensive support for MapleStory SEA API endpoints with English localization and SEA-specific features.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Complete SEA API Integration**: Ensure all MapleStory SEA API endpoints are properly supported
2. **English Localization**: Translate and localize all Korean content to English
3. **SEA-Specific Features**: Add SEA server-specific functionality and data handling
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive English documentation

## Current Status Analysis

The project has already been successfully forked and basic SEA API integration is working. Key improvements have been made to API connection reliability with timeout optimizations specifically for SEA servers.

## Scope of Work

### 1. API Endpoint Verification and Completion
- Verify all SEA API endpoints are implemented and working
- Add any missing SEA-specific endpoints
- Ensure proper error handling for SEA API responses
- Validate data structure compatibility with SEA API

### 2. Localization Tasks
- Translate all Korean text strings to English
- Localize error messages and user-facing content
- Update documentation from Korean to English
- Ensure proper character encoding for SEA region

### 3. SEA-Specific Customizations
- Configure SEA server world names (Aquila, Bootes, Cassiopeia, Delphinus)
- Add SEA-specific job classes and features
- Implement SEA region date/time formatting
- Add SEA-specific validation rules

### 4. Documentation and Examples
- Create comprehensive English README
- Write usage examples specific to SEA servers
- Document API differences between KMS and SEA
- Provide installation and configuration guides

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Test all API endpoints with SEA servers
- Verify localized content displays correctly
- Ensure proper error handling in English
- Validate MCP integration works seamlessly

## Technical Requirements

### Localization Standards
- All user-facing text must be in English
- Error messages should be clear and informative
- Date formats should follow SEA regional standards (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Time zones should be appropriately handled for SEA region

### API Compatibility
- Maintain full compatibility with existing MCP protocol
- Ensure all SEA API endpoints are accessible
- Proper handling of SEA-specific data structures
- Robust error handling for SEA API limitations

### Code Quality
- Maintain clean, readable English comments
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Proper TypeScript types for all SEA-specific data
- Comprehensive error handling

## Deliverables

### 1. Fully Localized Codebase
- All Korean strings translated to English
- Localized error messages and notifications
- English comments and documentation in code

### 2. SEA API Integration
- Complete endpoint coverage for SEA servers
- Proper data validation for SEA-specific responses
- Optimized performance for SEA API characteristics

### 3. Documentation Package
- English README with setup instructions
- API reference documentation
- Usage examples and tutorials
- Migration guide from original server

### 4. Testing Suite
- Comprehensive test coverage for SEA endpoints
- Localization verification tests
- Integration tests with actual SEA API
- Performance validation tests

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- All SEA API endpoints working correctly
- Complete English localization without Korean remnants
- Proper SEA server world and job class support
- Seamless MCP integration for Claude Desktop

### Quality Standards
- 100% English localization coverage
- All API endpoints tested and verified
- Clear, professional documentation
- No breaking changes to existing MCP functionality

### Performance Targets
- API response times under 2 seconds for 95% of requests
- Successful handling of SEA API rate limits
- Stable operation under normal usage patterns
- Proper memory usage without leaks

## Timeline and Phases

### Phase 1: Core Localization (Priority: High)
- Translate all Korean strings in source code
- Localize error messages and user notifications
- Update configuration for SEA regions

### Phase 2: API Enhancement (Priority: High)
- Verify and complete SEA API endpoint coverage
- Implement SEA-specific data validation
- Add missing SEA server features

### Phase 3: Documentation (Priority: Medium)
- Create comprehensive English documentation
- Write usage examples and tutorials
- Document SEA-specific features and limitations

### Phase 4: Testing and Polish (Priority: Medium)
- Comprehensive testing of all features
- Performance optimization for SEA API
- Final quality assurance and bug fixes

## Constraints and Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with MCP protocol
- Limited by SEA API rate limits and response times
- Need to handle SEA API-specific error conditions
- TypeScript compatibility requirements

### Resource Constraints
- Focus on essential localization and API features
- Avoid over-engineering beyond core requirements
- Prioritize user-facing improvements
- Maintain simple, maintainable codebase

## Risk Mitigation

### API Reliability
- Implement robust error handling for SEA API issues
- Add appropriate timeout and retry logic
- Provide clear error messages for API failures

### Localization Quality
- Systematic review of all translated content
- Validation of technical terminology
- Consistency checks across all components

This PRD focuses specifically on the core objectives of creating a fully localized MapleStory SEA MCP Server with proper English localization and complete SEA API support.
